                <p>At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not go as high as 221. In fact, <em>number 85</em> was the last number of the street in 1890.</p>

                <p>Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the <em>Abbey National Building Society</em> moved into premises at <em>219–229 Baker Street.</em> For many years, Abbey National employed a full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes.</p>

                <h2>The Sherlock Holmes Museum</h2>
                <p id='mapScene1'>In 1990, a <em>blue plaque</em> signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same block, and there followed a <em>15-year dispute</em> between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to 221B Baker Street.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='text__container' id='mapScene2'>
                <p>Since the closure of Abbey House in <em>2005</em>, ownership of the address by the Sherlock Holmes Museum has not been challenged. The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an <em>1815 townhouse</em> very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between <em>237 and 241 Baker Street.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class='text__container' id='mapScene3'>
                <p>The museum displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum.</p>
            </div>

            <div class='text__container' id='mapScene4'>
                <p>The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 steps leading from the ground-floor hallway to the first-floor study. In <em>'A Study in Scarlet’ (1887)</em>, Conan Doyle writes:</p>
    
                <blockquote class='subpage__quote'>We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.</blockquote>
